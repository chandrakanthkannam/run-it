  - [ ] Add command scheduling capabilities

- [ ] **API Improvements**
  - [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - [ ] Implement API versioning
  - [ ] Add pagination for command history
  - [ ] Support for command cancellation

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Logging Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add structured logging with context
  - [ ] Implement audit logging for security events
  - [ ] Add performance metrics logging
  - [ ] Support for external log aggregation

- [ ] **Metrics & Health Checks**
  - [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoint
  - [ ] Add command execution statistics
  - [ ] Monitor system resource usage

### Data Persistence
- [ ] **External Datastore Integration**
  - [ ] Add SQLite support for command history
  - [ ] Implement Redis for caching and state
  - [ ] Add database migration system
  - [ ] Support for command result archiving

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Always create tests before implementing features**
2. **Security review required for all authentication/authorization changes**
3. **Performance benchmarking for concurrency improvements**
4. **Documentation updates with each feature**

### Code Standards
- Follow Rust naming conventions and idioms
- Use `clippy` for code quality checks
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Add comprehensive documentation comments

### Security Review Checklist
